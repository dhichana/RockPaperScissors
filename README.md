# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

## Overview

This is a simple command-line Rock, Paper, Scissors game implemented in Python. The game allows users to play against the computer by choosing one of the three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The winner is determined based on the classic rules of the game.

## Usage

1. Run the `rock_paper_scissors.py` script in a Python environment.
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to input your choice (rock, paper, or scissors).
3. The computer randomly selects its move, and the winner is determined.

## Game Rules

- **Rock beats Scissors:** Rock crushes scissors.
- **Scissors beats Paper:** Scissors cut paper.
- **Paper beats Rock:** Paper covers rock.

## File Structure

- `rock_paper_scissors.py`: Main Python script containing the Rock, Paper, Scissors game implementation.
- `README.md`: Documentation file providing information about the game and how to play it.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Run the Game

## Notes

- Ensure Python is installed on your system.
- The game is case-insensitive for user input (e.g., "Rock" and "rock" are treated the same).

## Additional Features

- You can extend the game by adding a scoring system to keep track of wins, losses, and ties.
- Consider implementing a loop to allow users to play multiple rounds without restarting the script.
